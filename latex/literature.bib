@article{devops-definition,
	abstract = {Abstract DevOps as a new way of thinking for software development and operations has received much attention in the industry, while it has not been thoroughly investigated in academia yet. The objective of this study is to characterize DevOps by exploring its central components in terms of principles, practices and their relations to the principles, challenges of DevOps adoption, and benefits reported in the peer-reviewed literature. As a key objective, we also aim to realize the relations between DevOps practices and benefits in a systematic manner. A systematic literature review was conducted. Also, we used the concept of benefits dependency network to synthesize the findings, in particular, to specify dependencies between DevOps practices and link the practices to benefits. We found that in many cases, DevOps characteristics, ie, principles, practices, benefits, and challenges, were not sufficiently defined in detail in the peer-reviewed literature. In addition, only a few empirical studies are available, which can be attributed to the nascency of DevOps research. Also, an initial version of the DevOps benefits dependency network has been derived. The definition of DevOps principles and practices should be emphasized given the novelty of the concept. Further empirical studies are needed to improve the benefits dependency network presented in this study.},

@article{common-block-size,
	abstract = {Knowledge of the file size distribution is needed to optimize file system design. In particular, if all the files are small, the disk block size should be small, too, to avoid wasting too large a fraction of the disk. On the other hand, if files are generally large, choosing a large block size is good since it leads to more efficient transfers. Only by knowing the file size distribution can reasonable choices be made. In 1984, we published the file size distribution for a university computer science department. We have now made the same measurements 20 years later to see how file sizes have changed. In short, the median file size has more than doubled (from 1080 bytes to 2475 bytes), but large files still dominate the storage requirements.},

@inproceedings{web-caching-simulation,
	abstract = {In this paper, we present the Dichotomized Cache Management (DCM) scheme for Web caches. The motivation of the DCM scheme is discovered by observing the Web reference behavior from the viewpoint of Belady's optimal replacement algorithm. The observation shows that 1) separate allocation of cache space for temporal locality and reference popularity better approximates the optimal algorithm, and 2) the contribution of temporal locality and reference popularity on the performance of caching is dependent on the cache size. With these observations, we devise the DCM scheme that provides a robust framework for on-line detection and allocation of cache space based on the marginal contribution of temporal locality and reference popularity. Trace-driven simulations with actual Web cache logs show that DCM outperforms existing schemes for various performance measures for a wide range of cache configurations.},

@article{mru-reasoning,
	abstract = {In this paper we present a new algorithm, DBMIN, for managing the buffer pool of a relational database management system. DBMIN is based on a new model of relational query behavior, thequery locality set model (QLSM). Like the hot set model, the QLSM has an advantage over the stochastic models due to its ability to predict future reference behavior. However, the QLSM avoids the potential problems of the hot set model by separating the modeling of reference behavior from any particular buffer management algorithm. After introducing the QLSM and describing the DBMIN algorithm, we present a performance evaluation methodology for evaluating buffer management algorithms in a multiuser environment. This methodology employed a hybrid model that combines features of both trace-driven and distribution-driven simulation models. Using this model, the performance of the DBMIN algorithm in a multiuser environment is compared with that of the hot set algorithm and four more traditional buffer replacement algorithms.},
